# Tensorflow Object Detection API
This is a simplified fork of the [master branch](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). 

We maintain this legacy version to avoid high maintenance cost to keep up with the master branch and to add some custom code. We recommend using their latest version if you want to train things from scratch.
